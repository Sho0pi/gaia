"""Regular-account WhatsApp adapter built on neonize (whatsmeow bindings).

Unlike the Cloud-API :class:`~gaia.connectors.whatsapp.WhatsAppConnector`, this
talks the WhatsApp-Web multidevice protocol: a personal account pairs by scanning
a QR code printed to the terminal on first run, and the session is persisted to a
local SQLite db so subsequent runs reconnect without a new scan.

Deferred import keeps the module importable without the neonize dep installed, so
unit tests can exercise the wiring without the native whatsmeow binary.
